    lib dependents

This library makes available a simple model for implementing change
dependencies.  The idea is that you are able to add procedures (or
items with a suitable class_apply) to the list of dependencies of an
item.  When that item is changed -notify_dependents- is called to
apply the dependents are apply'd in order.


add_dependent( PROC, ITEM )
        Adds the procedure PROC to the list of dependents of ITEM.


del_dependent( PROC, ITEM )
        Removes the procedure PROC to the list of dependents of ITEM.


is_dependent( PROC, ITEM ) -> BOOL
BOOL -> is_dependent( PROC, ITEM )
        Tests whether PROC is a dependent of ITEM.  (The test used is
        -==-.)  In update mode, it adds PROC or deletes PROC according
        to whether BOOL is <true> or <false>.


app_dependents( ITEM, PROC )
        Apply PROC to each of the dependents of ITEM.  The order of
        application is not defined.


notify_dependents( ITEM )
        Sequentially applies the dependents of ITEM in any order.
