#_INSTALL_SCRIPT <production file-name>

This macro is a convenient way of installing a script into the current
scene of a HiP production.  It reads the remainder of the file into a
string and then inserts that into the "script" property of the current
scene.

Note that this macro performs a -hip_go_production- prior to reading the
file.  This ensures that the production is open and the script gets
installed in the correct place.
