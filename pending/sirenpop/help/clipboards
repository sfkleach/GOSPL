    lib clipboards

This library provides a set of functions for creating, adding, and
deleting elements from clipboards.  Clipboards are an imperative
implementation of bags (i.e. mappings from items to the natural
numbers).

add_clipboard( ITEM, CB )
        Adds ITEM to clipboard CB.  This has the effect of incrementing
        the count of ITEM by 1.


app_clipboard( CB, PROC )
        Applies PROC to all the items and their counts on the clipboard
        in turn.  PROC must have the form
            PROC( ITEM, N )
        It is free to consume or return values to the stack.


del_clipboard( ITEM, CB )
        Deletes one copy of item ITEM from clipboard CB.  This
         has the effect of decrementing the count of ITEM by 1.


is_clipboard( ITEM ) -> BOOL
        Returns <true> if ITEM is a clipboard, otherwise <false>.


new_clipboard( ASSOC_LIST, EQUALITY )
        Creates a new clipboard whose initial contents is determined
        by the association list ASSOC_LIST.


on_clipboard( ITEM, CB ) -> NAT
NAT -> on_clipboard( ITEM, CB )
        Returns (or updates) the number of copies of ITEM on
        clipboard CB.


length_clipboard( CB ) -> NAT
        Returns the total number of items on the clipboard.
