 -- White Space
 -- Formal Parameter Declarations
 -- Indentation rules
 -- Laying out large expressions

These notes outline some programming style guidelines for the SIREN
work.  The purpose of having a uniform style is to help make code
written by several people more easily readable.  These notes are
guidelines rather than instructions -- they should be ignored if other
factors are more important.


-- White Space

-- Formal Parameter Declarations

-- Loop Variables

-- Indentation rules
