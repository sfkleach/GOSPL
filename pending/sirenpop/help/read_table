read_table(
    FILE or CHARACTER_RPTR,
    [ WIDTH ],
    [ SEPARATOR_CHAR, QUOTE_FLAG ]
) -> LIST

This procedure reads from a file or character repeater that represents a
table.  The file is typically a tab-separated database dump.

    FILE            A filename reprsented as a string.
    WIDTH           The number of fields per line required.
    SEPARATOR_CHAR  The character used to separate fields in the database.
    QUOTE_FLAG:     <true> to use double quotes for strings
                    <false> to use single quotes for strings

It returns a dynamic list of table lines, each line being parsed into a
vector of fields.  Fields are parsed according to roughly the same
itemisation rules as Pop11 with one exception: tabs are treated as
separators.  Blank lines are ignored; this makes it possible to insert
comments into the data.
