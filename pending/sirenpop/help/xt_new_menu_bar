    xt_new_menu_bar( PARENT, [NAME], BINDING1, ..., BINDINGn )
        -> WIDGET

This procedure creates a new Motif menubar widget using -XmCreateMenuBar-.
The arguments are processed using *XT_NEW_ARGS.

The menu bar widget returned by this function is not managed.  I think
this is the right thing to do but iot may need review.
