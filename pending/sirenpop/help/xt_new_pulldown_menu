    xt_new_pulldown_menu( PARENT, [NAME], BINDING1, ..., BINDINGn )
        -> WIDGET

This procedure creates a Motif pulldown menu widget.  The arguments are
processed using *XT_NEW_ARGS.

The created widget is not automatically managed -- since management and
pulldown visibility are conflated in the toolkit.
