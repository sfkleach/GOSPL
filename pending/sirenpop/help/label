HELP LABEL                                              Steve Knight, Oct 93

    label WORD:

This syntax word is used to sets labels that are targets of "goto" and
"go_on" statements.  It is an alternative to the standard syntax for
labels.

The advantage of writing
    label foo:
rather simply
    foo:
is that autoloading is inhibited in the former but, unfortunately,
triggered in the latter.
