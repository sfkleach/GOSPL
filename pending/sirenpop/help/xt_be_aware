xt_be_aware( SHELL_WIDGET )

This procedure makes shell widgets behave in a way that is typically
useful in the POPLOG environment.  Because these behaviours can only
be applied when the shell is realized, it will apply XtRealize if
necessary.

    -   Sensitive to busy states (see REF *XptBusyCursorOn)

    -   Protected against garbage collection, regardless of whether
        it is held in any variables. (See HELP *XT_GC_PROTECT)

    -   Smart about window manager deletion requests.  The natural
        response should be to delete a single window not (as seems
        common) to crash the application.

A shell that does all these things is ``aware'' and is, as a result,
much more useful than your average shell.
