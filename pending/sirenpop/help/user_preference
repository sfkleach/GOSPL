user_preference( FILE ) -> PROP

This function takes the name of a preferences-file and returns an
access/update procedure.  The returned procedure works rather like a
Pop11 property (see REF * DBM for details) with a default of <false>.

If the preferences file does not exist then it is automatically created.
