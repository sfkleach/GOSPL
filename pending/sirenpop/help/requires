HELP REQUIRES                                           Steve Knight, Nov 93

requires library <NAME>;
requires loading <NAME>;

The syntax word "requires" is useful for loading files relative to a
particular path.

    requires library <NAME>     searches -popuseslist-
    requires loading <NAME>     searches for file in current directory

Once the file is loaded by -requires-, it is never loaded again.  (The
absolute name of the file is saved.)
