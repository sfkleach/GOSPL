        PARENT, [NAME], BINDING1, ..., BINDINGn, [MANAGED],
        STRING, ITEM_LIST
    ) -> PARENT, [NAME], BINDING1, ..., BINDINGn, [MANAGED]

This procedure is used to perform the preprocessing of the arguments
to implement the xt_new_<name>_f constructors.  It is not intended for
general use.
