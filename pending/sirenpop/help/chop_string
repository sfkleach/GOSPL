chop_string( STRING ) -> STRING1, ..., STRINGn

Chops a string into lots of little strings using spaces, tabs, and
newlines as boundary characters.  If there are adjacent white space
characters then all but the first is ignored.

NOTE:
    I plan to extend this procedure to take optional parameters
    specifying the predicate identifying boundary characters
    and whether or not to ignore adjacent boundary characters.
