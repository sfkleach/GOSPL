syssort_by( LIST, [BOOL], ACCESS_PROC, CMP_PROC ) -> LIST

This procedure sorts a list of items LIST according to the access
procedure ACCESS_PROC and the comparison procedure CMP_PROC.  The
boolean flag BOOL, if <false>, indicates that the sort should be
non-copying.

The comparison of items in the list is performed according to
the predicate

    CMP_PROC( ACCESS_PROC( ITEM1 ), ACCESS_PROC( ITEM2 ) )

This function simplifies many of the uses of *SYSSORT.
