    string_to_term( STRING ) -> PROLOG_TERM or FALSE
    string_to_term_error -> STRING

This library makes available the procedure -string_to_term- which parses
a string and returns a Prolog term.  If the string is not readable as a
Prolog term then it returns <false> and the (active) variable
-string_to_term_error- is set to an appropriate error message.
