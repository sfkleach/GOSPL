substitute_substring( X, Y, STR ) -> STR'

This procedure substitutes occurences of the string X with the string Y
in STR to produce a new string STR'. Note that if the substitutions are
"non-overlapping", exactly like the substitutions of a text editor.
This means that the text of Y is never itself checked for containing
occurences of X.

Example:

    : ;;; A simple example.
    : substitute_substring( 'kiss', 'chase', 'dogs like to kiss rats' ) =>
    ** 'dogs like to chase rats'
    :
    : ;;; Shows how the substitutions are non-overlapping.  In other words
    : ;;; there can be a 'nana' substring left in the result.
    : substitute_substring( 'nana', 'na', 'bananana' ) =>
    ** 'banana'
    :
