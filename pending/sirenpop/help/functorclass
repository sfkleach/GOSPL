    functorclass <NAME> [ as <NAME> ] <FIELD1> ... <FIELDn> ;

This syntax word is a convenient way of defining procedures for
manipulating prolog terms of a particular functor/arity.

e.g.

    functorclass , as comma
        comma_lhs
        comma_rhs;

NOTE:
    This should be improved to handle "lconstant" and other declaration
    modifiers.  At the moment all the variables are declared as
    permanent procedure globals.
