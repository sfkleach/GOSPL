    xt_new_arglist( BINDING1, ..., BINDINGn ) -> ARGLIST

A convenience function that creates a list of arguments suitable for
-XptArgList- or -XptVaArglist- from an arbitrary number of bindings
on top of the stack.

A binding is EITHER of the following

    (1) A vector of even length.  This is divided into 2-vectors which
        are inserted into the result list.  So as well as writing
            {numColumns 4} {packing ^XmPACK_TIGHT}
        one can write
            {numColumns 4 packing ^XmPACK_TIGHT}

    (2) A vector of bindings.
