==================================================

This file lists all of the files in this terminal directory. It
also lists the files you will need to provide the documented
facilities.

The numbers to the left of the file names are their sizes in K
Bytes. These numbers, and comments beginning with "#", will be
stripped out by the archive server, so you needn't remove them,
unless you want to.
