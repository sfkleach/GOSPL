GOSPL Build Directory

--- History

This was resurrected from various old copies of the GOSPL lying around on my hard drives.

The file "mkcontents.p" was responsible for concatenating all the README files from all over the projects. This was evidently discontinued by version 1.2.1. I presume my ideas of structured projects were becoming more regular.

The file "make_readme.p" was responsible for creating the CONTENTS.html & CONTENTS.txt file for each project. This was an evident misnomer and so I have renamed it "make_contents.p". The main thing wrong with it is that it does not create a top-level CONTENTS.html/txt file at the $popgospl level.
