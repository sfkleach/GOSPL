Welcome to the GOSPL development directory
==========================================

Rules for Developers
--------------------

[1] Conventions

At the start of each file there should appear some documentation
comments

    Summary: ...
    Version: ....

The summary line is a 1-line summary of the function of the file and
the version line gives the version number of the file.


[2] Homing

I have swapped back and forth between using ~popgospl/gospl and
$popgospl to determine the location of the key directory.  With the
new Assembla.Com hosting I've decided to switch to $popgospldev as
it will be more straightforward to support.


[3] section $-gospl

When it is appropriate to introduce sections, I have tried to make
sure that $-gospl is the head of the hierarchy.
