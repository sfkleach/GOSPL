HELP CONSREPEATER                               Steve Knight, Oct 91

    consrepeater( i1, ..., iN, N ) -> R

This procedure constructs a repeater from the top N items of the stack.
It is mainly useful for constructing repeaters from unusual sources.

e.g. converting a vector into a repeater

    lvars R = {a b c d}.destvector.consrepeater;
    repeat 5 times R() endrepeat =>
    ** a b c d <termin>
