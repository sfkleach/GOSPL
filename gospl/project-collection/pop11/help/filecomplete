HELP FILECOMPLETE        Steve Knight      2nd March 89

"filecomplete" takes an initial part of a filename and returns all the
possible completions as a dynamic list.  A completion does NOT include the
initial segment.  Thus trying to complete '.log' in my home directory does
this,

    filecomplete( '.log' ).expandlist =>
    ** [in in-]

showing that I have two files '.login' and '.login-'.
