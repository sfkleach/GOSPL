HELP CALLSLIST                               Chris Thornton  August 1984


CALLSLIST  is a procedure which returns a list of sublists representing the
'call' structure of a POP11 program. The procedure assumes that the program to
be analysed is in the current VED buffer.

The list returned contains sublists of the form

      [<caller procedure>  {<called procedure>} ]

The HD of the sublist contains the name of the caller procedure and the TL of
the sublist contains the names of all called procedures (if there are any).
