HELP CLIQUES   -- Jon Cunningham  84 (modified slightly by Chris Thornton)


CLIQUES(network, level) -> clique_network;

Returns a 'clique-analysis' of the network.

<network> should be of the form:  [<node> <relatives>]

<level> should be an integer between 1 and 4

Higher <level> args obtain more restrained clique-analysis although
(at present) 3 and 4 obtain exactly the same analysis.
