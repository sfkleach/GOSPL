    length_>=( Item, <N:integral> ) -> <boolean>

This procedure returns the same as the expression
    length( Item ) >= N
would return.  However, in the particular case of lists, it examines
the minimum number of pairs to establish the truth of the predicate.

Item can be a list, a vectorclass object, or a word.  N must be integral.
