HELP GENSYMBEFORE                                   R.Evans March 1984

This procedure takes two words or strings as arguments and returns TRUE or
FALSE according to whether the following criterion:

Each word is split into two parts - a numeric part, consisting of all the
digits (if any) at the RIGHT HAND END of the word, and an alphabetic part,
consisting of the rest of the string. The alphabetic parts are compared using
ALPHABEFORE, and if they are not identical, the result is returned. If the y
are identical, the numeric parts are viewed as numbers and < is used to
determine the ordering.

Thus GENSYMBEFORE behaves like ALPHABEFORE except for words of the form
produced by GENSYM. These are ordered in the same order as GENSYM produced
them.

For example:

    : GENSYMBEFORE("CAT","DOG") =>
    ** <TRUE>
    : GENSYMBEFORE("CAT1","CAT2")=>
    ** <TRUE>
    : GENSYMBEFORE("CAT2","CAT12") =>
    ** <TRUE>                               (ALPHABEFORE gives <FALSE>)
