HELP EXTEND_SECTION                                   Jon Meyer 1992

lib extend_section

This library modifies the section/endsection syntax to act in the same
way as module/endmodule.  This provides an enhancement to section that
allows names to be shared between sections without them being visible in
any other sections.  This syntax is backward compatible with the old
section/endsection syntax.

With this syntax you can write

    section $-hip
        import:
            import_name1
        export:
            export_name1
            export_name2
        subscribe:
            $-propsheet with_prefix ps_
            $-xlib
            $-myutils
        publish:
            setup
            quit
        ;

    endsection;
