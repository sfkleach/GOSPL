HELP FOR_LVARS                                      Steve Leach, Jun 98

    for lvars ...

This is an extension of the "for" syntax that makes it compatible
with the new "lfor" syntax.  For example, instead of writing

    lfor i in list [ a b c ] do ....

one could write

    for lvars i in list [ a b c ] do ...

It is provided to allow people to use the more familiar "for"
keyword while being 100% backward compatible with existing code.
