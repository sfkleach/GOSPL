<| STATEMENTS |>
<| VARIABLES : STATEMENTS |>

The <| ... |> syntax is a shorthand for writing procedures.  Optional
input locals should comma-separated and followed by a ":".  The main
body is a general Pop11 statement.

Example:
    <| x, y : y, x |> is a procedure to swap the top two items on the stack
    <| rev(); hd() |> is a procedure that finds the last element. cf -last-
    <| swap( 3 )() |> is a procedure that takes the third element. cf. -third-

On a stylistic note, this syntax really is intended for short definitions.
It is intended to enhance readability when programming with higher-order
functions such as -maplist- by keeping expressions visually compact.
Using it for functions which spill over a couple of lines would be an
bad idea.  (But we're not stopping you because we know sometimes you are
in a hurry or just think differently to us.)
