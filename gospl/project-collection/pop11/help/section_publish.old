Publishing and Subscribing Section Identifiers
----------------------------------------------
A section SECT can "publish" the names of identifiers which it wishes to
make available to other sections.  These other sections need NOT be
subsections, or indeed related in any way to SECT.  By subscribing to
SECT, other sections will have available to them all the identifiers
published by SECT (in this document, this process is described as
"transporting" variables from the SECT into the section that subscribes
to SECT).  Thus "publishers" act as providers of identifiers, whereas
"subscribers" are users of those identifiers.

Using publish and subscribe, it is very easy for sections to access and
share identifiers without also making those identifiers top-level global
variables.

When a section subscribes to SECT, it can specify a way to map between
the names of identifiers published by SECT and the local names that are
to be used.  Thus each user of SECT can use its own naming conventions
for naming identifiers published by SECT.

Generally speaking, the section that publishes an identifier name is
also the section that declares it and defines its value, although this
need not be the case.


Procedures
----------
The programming interface to publishing and subscribing for sections is
described below:

section_publish(WORD)                                        [procedure]
        Marks WORD as the name of an identifier in the current section
        which will be made available to other sections that subsequently
        subscribe to the current section (see below).


section_subscribe(SECT, PREFIX)                              [procedure]
        For each word published by SECT, transports the identifier that
        is associated with the word in SECT into the current section,
        under a name which is determined by PREFIX: if PREFIX is
        <false>, the identifiers are made available using the same names
        that are published by SECT; If PREFIX is a word, the new name is
        formed by concatenating PREFIX onto the front of the published
        name; If PREFIX is a procedure, it is passed each published name
        in turn and should return the new name.

        Any previous identifiers associated with subscribed words will
        be cancelled.


Declaring Variables
-------------------
If an identifier name is published by SECT, but it is not declared when
another section subscribes to SECT, the section mechanism will first
attempt to autoload the identifier.  If this fails, a warning message is
printed, and the identifier is automatically declared (using
-sysdeclare-).


The Toplevel Section
--------------------
You cannot subscribe to the top-level section (attempting to do so
generates a mishap).  Likewise, you cannot publish things from the
top-level section.

The top-level section can, however, subscribe to other sections - that
is, it is possible to transport published variables from nested sections
into the top-level section.  This is useful when you wish to try out a
section interactively.


Autoloading
-----------
If you subscribe to a section which does not publish anything, the
section mechanism first attempts to autoload the file with the same name
as the section you subscribe to.  If, after autoloading, there is still
nothing to subscribe to, you will get a warning message.  (Usually, if
you subscribe to a section that doesn't publish anything it is because
(a) you are trying to subscribe to a section which doesn't partake of
the publish/subscibe mechanism, or (b) the code for the section is not
loaded, or (c) because you incorrectly typed the section name).


Global, Imported or Exported Variables
--------------------------------------
The section publish/subscribe mechanism is separate from the *GLOBAL
attributes of section identifiers.  That is, if SECT defines a nonglobal
variable -foo- and publishes that variable, subscribers to SECT will
also access the same (and hence nonglobal) variable -foo- (so
subsections of those subscribers will not have access to -foo-).
Conversely, if -baz- is a global variable published by SECT, the
variable -bza- that is seen by subscribers to SECT will also be global
(and therefore inherited by subsctions of those other sections).

A section SECT may also publish a variable which is imported from the
parent of the section, rather than defined locally in the SECT.  In this
case, the publish/subscribe mechanism works just as if it was the parent
section that published that variable, and subscribers had subscribed to
the parent section for just that variable.

HELP * MODULE           module/endmodule is an alternative syntax for
                        sections that permits publishing and
                        subscribing.

HELP * EXTEND_SECTION   This library modifies the section/endsection
                        syntax to work the same way as module/endmodule.
