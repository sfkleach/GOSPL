libsrc <filename>;

This command works identically to "lib" except that files on the -vedsrclist-
are searched, rather than -popuseslist-.  This is useful when using
* LOAD_PACKAGE for loading files from the "src" directory.  Files loaded in
this way can be viewed later, using the -ved_src- command.
