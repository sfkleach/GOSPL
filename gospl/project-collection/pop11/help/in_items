HELP IN_ITEMS              26th Feb 1990                Steve Knight x 24061

for i, j, k in_items EXPR, EXPR, EXPR do
    ACTIONS
endfor

This for loop extension is suitable for iterating over expressions which dump
their results onto the stack.  Roughly speaking the construct is equivalent to

fast_for i, j, k in [% EXPR %], [% EXPR %], [% EXPR %] do
    ACTIONS
endfor

except that the lists are reclaimed during the execution of the loop.  The
loop quits as soon as any of the expressions are exhausted.

e.g. Here's one way to interleave two strings

    consstring(#|
        lvars i, j;
        for i, j in_items 'cat'.explode, 'dog'.explode do
            i, j
        endfor;
    |#) =>
    ** cdaotg

There is no fast version of this loop.
