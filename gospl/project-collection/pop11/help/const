HELP CONST                                      Steve Knight, Oct 91

    const( x )( y ) -> x

This simple procedure is called the K, or constant, combinator.  When applied
to an item x, it returns a procedure that will deliver x when applied to
any other value y.

The main use of -const- is when specialising procedures written in the
functional style.

e.g.
    const( 99 )( "fred" ) =>
    ** 99

    maplist( [a b c], const( 0 ) ) =>
    ** [0 0 0]
