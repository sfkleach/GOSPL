HELP IN_DIRECTORY                               Steve Knight, 14 Oct 1991

    for <variable> in_directory <expression> do
        <STATEMENTS>
    endfor

This for-loop extension enables you to loop over all the files in a directory
(excluding '.' and '..') in a convenient fashion.

Note that the loop variable is declared for you as an LVARS.  This is not
yet standard with for-loops but it protects you against forgetting to declare
the loop-variables.

For more information on for-loop extensions see * FOR_FORM.
