    usessrc <filename>;

This command works identically to "uses" except that files on the
-vedsrclist- are searched, rather than -popuseslist-.  This is useful
when using *LOAD_PROJECT for loading files from the "src" directory.
Files loaded in this way can be viewed later, using the -ved_src-
command.
