HELP MAPREPEATER                                Steve Knight, Oct 91

    maprepeater( R, F ) -> MR

This procedure converts a repeater R into a new repeater MR such that
    MR() == F( R() )
i.e. each element has F applied to them.  However, unlike "apprepeater",
the repeater R is not expanded.

In addition, the new repeater has an updater, so that values can be pushed
back onto the repeaters internal buffer.
