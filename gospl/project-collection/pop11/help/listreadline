HELP LISTREADLINE                       Jonathan Laventhol, 13 December 1983.

    A procedure like READLINE, but one which will make nested lists.

    : listreadline() =>
    ? hello [a b c]
    ** [hello [a b c]]

    If the nested list doesn't have matching brackets then the result will
be false:

    : listreadline() =>
    ? hello there [1 2
    ** <false>
