HELP DISCINLINE                        Steve Knight, March 1990

    discinline( filename ) -> line repeater;

This procedure is roughly equivalent in functionality (but faster) to
    discin <> incharline
in that it accepts a filename, as a string, and returns a line repeater.  The
line repeater is a procedure that returns the next line of the file each time
it is called.  When it is exhausted it returns termin.

-discinline- works by opening the file as a line oriented device.  Therefore
it is not appropriate to supply it with an already opened device, as you may
do with discin.
