Overview
--------
This document  describes a  collection of  facilities for  printing  VED
files, including their character  attributes (bold, underline, etc.)  to
PostScript printers.


The following  constants hardwired  into the  PostScript  output

    lines per page: 66
    rows per line: 80
    page size: A4
    left,bottom margin: 0.5", 0.5"
    font: 11 point courier

The following dstring text attributes are coped with:

    bold, italic, underlined, inverse video, coloured text.

The following extended characters are also dealt with:

    standard graphics characters (\G- \Glt \Gbr etc.)
    ISOLatin1 characters

See REF * ITEMISE * POP_CHARACTER_SET.

Printing to PostScript printers from VED
----------------------------------------
If you do (possibly in your vedinit.p file):

    uses vedpsprint;

Now <ENTER> print  and <ENTER> printmr  are extended to  allow an  extra
option, '-d', which allows you to specify the output device type. If you
use '-d ps'  (currently the  only argument  the '-d'  accepts) then  the
output device  type is  assumed  to be  a  PostScript printer,  and  VED
generates PostScript code  which prints bold,  italic, underlining,  and
inverse video correctly.  If you  specify no output  device type,  ASCII
output is generated.

See HELP * VED_PRINT for details on options to <ENTER> print.

For example:

    <ENTER> print -d ps

    <ENTER> printmr -d ps -p lw


Printing to PostScript printers from UNIX
-----------------------------------------
The library LIB * PSPRINT provides a UNIX command line interface to  the
VED PostScript printing facilities. This library is run by the
UNIX command psprint. For example:

    % psprint -p spa file1.p file2.p

prints the file 'file1.p' and 'file2.p' to the printer 'spa'.

PostScript Consumer
-------------------
The  VED  PostScript  printing  facility  works  using  the  low   level
PostScript line consumer:

postscript_line_consumer(DEVICE) -> CONSUME_P                [procedure]
        Takes a device and returns a consumer which takes (d)strings and
        writes them to device in as ASCII PostScript instructions  which
        a PostScript printer can interpret.

        CONSUME_P is a procedure of the form:

            CONSUME_P(DSTRING)

        When CONSUME_P is passed  -termin-, it generates the  PostScript
        code to print the contents of  the current page. If DEVICE  is a
        Poplog device, consuming  a -termin- does  not close the  device
        (the caller is responsible for closing it).

        If DEVICE is a string it is treated as a filename, and syscreate
        is used to create a new file. For this case only, CONSUME_P will
        close the  device it  creates when  it is  passed -termin-.

        The following  constants hardwired  into the  PostScript  output
        (wouldn't be too hard to change...)

            lines per page: 66
            rows per line: 80
            page size: 8" x 10.5"
            left,bottom margin: 0.5", 0.5"
            font: 11 point courier

        The following dstring text attributes are coped with:

            bold, italic, underlined, inverse video, coloured text.

        The following extended characters are also dealt with:

            standard graphics characters (\G- \Glt \Gbr etc.)
            ISOLatin1 characters

        See REF * ITEMISE * POP_CHARACTER_SET.

        For coloured  text,  the  consumer  will  print  foreground-only
        coloured  text  using  a  50%  gray,  and  foreground+background
        coloured text using a 20%/80% gray combination.
