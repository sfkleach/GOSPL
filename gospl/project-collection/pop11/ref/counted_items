REF COUNTED_ITEMS                                   Steve Knight, Oct 91

Counted-items are a sequence of items on the stack, topped by a count.  For
example, "deststring" returns all the characters in the string plus the length
of the string.

With the introduction of the count brackets "#|" and "|#" into Pop11, working
with groups of counted items becomes much easier.  Counted-items are a
powerful programming idea in Pop11 because they are a natural exchange format
between different datatypes.  For example, changing a vector into a list is
easily expressed as
    V.destvector.conslist
This expression works because "destvector" changes a vector into a
counted-item representation of a vector and "conslist" converts from a
the same representation to a list.

The procedures described in this file make counted-items a more effective way
of working.  Furthermore, they are often very efficient way of working because
Pop11 is optimised for stack usage.

+_n(#| numbers, ... |#) -> sum
    Finds the sum of the counted-items.  If the count is zero it returns 0.
    See HELP * +_N

*_n(#| numbers, ... |#) -> product
    Finds the product of the counted-items.  If the count is zero it
    returns 1.  See HELP * *_N

rev_n(#| items |#) -> (#| items' |#)
    Returns the counted-items in the reverse order.  The result is also a
    counted-group. See HELP * REV_N

syssort_n(#| items |#) -> (#| items' |#)
    Returns the counted-items, sorted into order.  The result is also a
    counted-group.  See HELP * SYSSORT_N
