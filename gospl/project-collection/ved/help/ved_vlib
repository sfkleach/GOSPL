VED_VLIB                                          Jonathan Meyer Nov 1992

        <ENTER> vlib <libname>    - Verbose version of LIB.
    or just:
        vlib <libname> ;

This command is just like <ENTER> lib except that it lists all of the
new top level identifiers that have been created by loading the library,
in a form which is ready for turning into a REF file. For example:

    <ENTER> vlib last
produces (if last has not yet been loaded):

last                                             [global vars procedure]

In addition, VLIB shows all of the variables that have been changed by
loading the library.

This information is useful for:

 o  documenting new libraries.

 o  verifying that a library defines the identifiers it says it does.

 o  spotting bugs in library identifier specifications.

 o  checking for clashes between two libraries.
