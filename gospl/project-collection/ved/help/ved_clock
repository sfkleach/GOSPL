    lib ved_clock

This library provides two ved commands ENTER CLOCK and ENTER SECS. ENTER CLOCK
switches the clock on and off alternately, while ENTER SECS switches between
displaying or not displaying seconds.

ENTER ALARM allows you to set a time for an alarm to go off. eg
    <enter> alarm 12:02
NB: alarm string must match time string exactly for alarm to ring.

The clock appears on the status line on the right hand side

Note: if you go out of VED the clock is stopped - you may get a double prompt
from POP11 (ignore it).

To get the clock on whenever you are in ved, add
    uses ved_clock
    $-clock$-startclock -> vedinitfile;
to your $poplib/vedinit.p file.
