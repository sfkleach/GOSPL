LOCAL HELP HELPLOG                              Jonathan Laventhol, 8 Oct 1984.

    HELPLOG is a cheap and cheerful demonstration of how to use the system
facility for logging documention file requests.  To make something tailored to
your needs, see the end of this file.  In some systems (notably the Sussex
unx1 system) it is used automatically.

    If HELPLOG is being used, every documentation file request (HELP, TEACH,
DOC, REF, SHOWLIB ...) will write a line to the logfile.  The logfile will be
called
        $usepop/pop/local/spool/helplogs/H466102337.1018

or somesuch (ie, with different numbers).

--- WHAT'S IN THE FILE -----------------------------------------------------

    The file with the silly name has got lines like this in it:

        ved_help 0 466102341 foo
        ved_showlib 0 466102347 bax
        ved_help $usepop/pop/help/index 466102350 index

    Which means I asked for help foo.  The 0 means that there isn't such
a file.  466102341 is the time and date, expressed in seconds from some time
in 1970.

    Four seconds later, I tried showlib bax, but couldn't find that either.
    Three seconds later, I succeeded in finding help index, which is the file
$usepop/pop/help/index.

--- FOR HACKERS ------------------------------------------------------------

    HELPLOG is used if it is autoloadable from a directory before $popautolib
in popliblist (say, for example, $poplocalauto).

    The format of each line in a helplog file is
        the pdprops of the caller of vedsysfile (typically ved_help)
        one space
        the filename of the file, or 0 if not found
        one space
        the date and time, in sys_real_time format (see ref * sysutil)
        one space
        the request, verbatim
        one newline

    The request is the last thing on the line because it can contain anything,
or may have been an empty string - programs reading this data should read to
the end of the line.

    The name of the log file is made from the date and the process number.
    The prefix 'H' on the log file name is the default -- set the environment
variable HELPLOGGROUP to be something else if you want different prefixes.
For example, in your .login file, add
        setenv HELPLOGGROUP dphil

    The files go into the directory $usepop/pop/local/spool/logfiles by
default -- set the environment variable HELPLOGDIR to something different if
you like.

    For converting the time and date, use SYS_CONVERT_DATE, see REF SYSUTIL.

    This program uses the system procedure *VEDSYSFILELOG, which is called
every time VEDSYSFILE is called, if set up right. See also *VEDSYSFILE.

    See the program for nitty gritty details: SHOWLIB HELPLOG
