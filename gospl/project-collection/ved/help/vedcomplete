HELP VEDCOMPLETE            Steve Knight          2nd March 89

"vedcomplete" determines the current item that the VED cursor is inside, by
working back to the first white space (see footnote), and tries to complete 
it as a filename.  If there are multiple completions it extends it as far 
as it can uniquely and then beeps.  If there are no completions it beeps.  
If there is a unique completion it simply extends it.

Footnote:
    In fact, it tries to complete back to the first space, tab, immediate
    mode space (char 160), or string quote.  This latter property is useful
    when writing filenames inside strings.
