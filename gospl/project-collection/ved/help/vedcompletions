HELP VEDCOMPLETIONS        Steve Knight          2nd March 89

"vedcompletions" displays all the possible completions in a new VED buffer,
called *COMPLETIONS*. It shows the file name in full and leaves the cursor
at the first line of the file.  A call to "vedusecompletion" will pick up the
current line and use that to complete the file name in the other buffer.
