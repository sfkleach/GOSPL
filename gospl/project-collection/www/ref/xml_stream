REF XML_STREAM                                          Steve Leach, Dec 05

This utility library provides facilities for creating XML streams from
character streams, manipulating them and accessing their state.  An XML stream
is responsible for recognizing the special characters "<" and ">", which are
returned as words, and decoding character sequences starting with "&".  All
other characters are returned as integers.


is_xml_stream( item ) -> bool
    Returns true if item is an XML stream, otherwise false.


new_xml_stream( rep, flags ) -> xmlstrm
    Returns an XML stream.  It takes two arguments, a character
    repeater -rep- and a list of flags.  The flags are words and may
    be either of
        accept      allow invalid &XXX; entities (default)
        mishap      forbid invalid &XXX; entities

    Note: this is a bug.  At the time of writing an XML stream has
    a built-in list of predefined "entities".


xml_stream_next_char( xmlstrm ) -> char
    Returns the next character.


xml_stream_line_col( xmlstrm ) -> ( line, posn )
    The current line number and position within the line.


xml_stream_skip_comment( xmlstrm, cons_comment )
    Reads up a character stream until two dashes in a row are
    found.
