HELP PROJECT_COLLECTIONS                            Steve Leach, Feb 05

Project collections simply directories containing project
subdirectories.  All of the enclosed projects can be made available via
the command

    : uses_project_collection <pathname>

However, this does not actually load the projects.  To to that you
would then use the command

    : uses_project <name>

Where <name> matches the name of a project directory of a project
collection.


Given that a GOSPL project is itself suitable for small to medium sized
coding efforts, a project collection suitable for organizing on a large
scale.  It would typically represent an archive of work by several
contributors or a single worker over a substantial period of time. The
GOSPL repository itself is a single project collection.
