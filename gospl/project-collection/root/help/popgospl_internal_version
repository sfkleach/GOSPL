HELP POPGOSPL_INTERNAL_VERSION                      Steve Leach, Dec 04

    popgospl_internal_version

A vectorclass object that provides the major, minor and incremental version
numbers of the version specification of the GOSPL library.

    popgospl_internal_version(1)        MAJOR
    popgospl_internal_version(2)        MINOR
    popgospl_internal_version(3)        INCREMENTAL

Currently implemented as a string.  However, its implementation may shift to
being a dstring or vector in the future - so don't rely on its representation
as being anything other than a vectorclass.
