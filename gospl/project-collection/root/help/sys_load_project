    sys_load_project( _______dirfile );

This procedure installs the directory or file _______dirfile as a new project.
If _______dirfile is a file, its parent directory is used in its place.  It
also runs any initialisation that might be required.  The directory is
expected to contain any of the following files and sub-directories.  If
the file/directory is missing, the appropriate action is simply omitted.

init.p          an initialisation file - the current directory is set to
                be <dir> while this is loading;
auto            directory for autoloading from (also can use "lib" explicitly)
doc             hard-copy documentation
help            on-line documentation
lib             library directory
src             source directory (see * LIBSRC)
ref             on-line reference information

By using load_project you can structure multi-file applications into single
projects which can be added to your local library in a structured manner.

To use the 'src' directory effectively, you may find it useful to
use the -libsrc- or -usessrc- command, which act as lib or uses but with
popuseslist rebound to vedsrclist.
