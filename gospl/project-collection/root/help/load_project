    load_project _________directory

This syntax word loads a directory as a GOSPL project.  The project structure
is as follows.  Note that all the files and directories are optional and may
be safely omitted.

    init.p ............ file loaded on "uses_project"
    auto/  ............ autoloadable directory
    help/  ............ help files, or "how-to"s, directory
    lib/   ............ library directory
    ref/   ............ reference files, see REF STANDARDS
    src/   ............ other source files
    teach/ ............ tutorial files

Loading a project extends the various Poplog search paths so that files in the
auto directory are autoloadable, files in the lib directory can be used, and
the help, teach, ref files are all accessible in Ved.
