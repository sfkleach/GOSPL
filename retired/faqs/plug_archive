HELP PLUG_ARCHIVE                                   Steve Knight, Oct 91

This file provides an overview of what's in the PLUG source code archive
and describes how to go about making the best use of it.  Some of this
material is also covered in the READMETOO file that comes with the
archive.  To find out about the latest additions to the archive read
HELP *PLUG_NEWS.

-- How The Archive Is Organised ---------------------------------------

The archive is a simple file hierarchy (no hard or soft links) in the general
form of the Poplog file hierarchy itself.  So under the $popplug directory
you will find something like this

    plug ----- pop --------------- pop11 ------------ help ---....

                               --- ved ---....

This hierarchy is added to the main Poplog hierarchy and the $poplocal
hierarchy.


-- General Information ------------------------------------------------

In addition to the collection of useful libraries, the plug archive
also contains valuable reference information.  The best starting point
for finding out about these is HELP *GENERAL_INFORMATION.


-- Packages For Pop11 programmers -------------------------------------

Pop11 is easily the best served of the Poplog languages.  Furthermore, this
software is continually revised, so it is the least likely to have dated
beyond recall.  In particular, there are lot of interesting service functions,
only a few of the most interesting ones are described here.  See the
$popplug/plug/pop/pop11/auto/README file for an exhaustive list.

lib module
    An essential alternative syntax for sections.  The module/endmodule
    syntax allows you to share identifiers between sections without
    making them visible to their mutual parents.

lib in_directory
    A for-extension that allows you to iterate over all the files in a
    directory.  Contributed by Steve Knight (HP Labs).  See *IN_DIRECTORY,
    *FILES_IN_DIRECTORY, *FILES_MATCHING.

lib repeaters
    A variety of procedures for dealing with repeaters Contributed by Steve
    Knight (HP Labs).  See HELP * REPEATERS.

lib counted_items
    A variety of procedures for dealing with counted-items i.e. a number of
    items on the stack topped by the count of the items.  Contributed nu
    Steve Knight (HP Labs). See HELP * COUNTED_ITEMS

lib tinyglobe
    A nice teaching example for people learning the Pop11 flavours package.
    Contributed by Chris Price (U. of Aberystwyth).  See HELP * TINYGLOBE.

lib ved_clock
    A ved-based alarm clock.  Wins the cuteness prize. Contributed by
    Roger Evans (U. of Sussex).  See HELP * VED_CLOCK.

lib popxpi
HELP *Xpi
    A great package from Jon Meyer (ISL) for image manipulation.


-- Packages For Lisp programmers --------------------------------------

OPS5
    This is a port of the public domain OPS5 implementation.  This port
    was contributed by Tom Khabaza (ISL).


-- Packages For Prolog programmers ------------------------------------

lib dollar_dollar
    A very useful syntax for contructing Prolog terms from inside
    Pop11.  Once you've used this you'll not understand why you didn't
    write one yourself.  (It's difficult to know where to put these
    mixed language items.)

    Contributed by Robin Popplestone.

POEM
    A simple object manipulation system for Prolog.  Contributed by
    Ben Staveley-Taylor (Plessy).


-- Packages For Standard ML programmers -------------------------------

Still waiting for contributions.


-- How To Keep The Archive Up To Date ---------------------------------

If you have problems in using the archive, find faults in the software, or
things of that kind, please e-mail the PLUG archive administrator with a
description of the problem. Currently, the address of the administrator is

    popforum-admin@hplb.hpl.hp.com

This will normally be answered by me (Steve Knight, HP Labs).

Equally, if you have suggestions for things you would like to see in the
archive, you should mail the administrator with a suggestion.  He/she may then
try to poll the Poplog User Group membership to see if there is already
something which fits the bill.

Lastly, you might like to submit a contribution.  Contact the administrator
EITHER with the software and documentation added to the message OR, if it is
too big, with a general description.  In the latter case, we will make
appropriate arrangements.  Contributions in the form of shar-archives or
or uuencoded &/ compressed &/ tar-archives are easiest for us to deal with.
