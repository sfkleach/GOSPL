-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

Popforum is a mailing list for people who are interested in Poplog and
other Pop languages.  This list is one of the services provided by the
Poplog and Pop Languages User Group.  So far the main uses of the forum
have been:

    *   discussing the future directions of Poplog;
    *   announcements of enhancements, conferences, or ideas;
    *   requests for help on various topics.

This list is actually a gateway through to the USENET group comp.lang.pop,
so if you have access to USENET we suggest you use popforum that way.


-- Members List -------------------------------------------------------

A list of popforum members is maintained by the administrator. This list
is sent to new members, and is occasionally sent to all members of
popforum, so that people with like interests can get in touch.  You can
mail to all members of the list by mailing to:

    popforum@hplb.hpl.hp.com

All mail to popforum is archived, because there are occasionally debates
or questions that are relevant  later. You can request 'back-issues'  of
mail discussions - see below.

[NOTE: at the time of writing, I haven't decided whether or not to
 mail the members list to popforum for a while.  This is because the
 list is sent to the USENET and therefore have enormous potential
 readership -- which raises some awkward ethical issues.  Until
 I have settled these issues I am playing safe.]


-- Joining Popforum --------------------------------------------------

If you want to join popforum, or to request back-issues, simply post to:

    popforum-admin@hplb.hpl.hp.com


-- Etiquette ----------------------------------------------------------

Since responsible people are reluctant to post trivial or dull questions
to everyone, some members (our Agony Aunts & Uncles) have volunteered to
field these kinds  of requests. These  people are listed  at the end  of
this file. To find out more, mail to:

    sfk@hplb.hpl.hp.com

As all the work that supports  the forum is voluntary and  out-of-hours,
we cannot always respond speedily. We hope that people will forgive such
delays and enjoy the services the forum offers.


-- Books and Resources List -------------------------------------------

The Poplog and Pop Languages User Group maintains a list of books,
papers, companies, and other resources related to Poplog.  Some of this
information may be  available in help files on your system (see  HELP
*GENERAL_INFORMATION for details), but if you want to add to this list 
or to see the most up-to-date version then mail:

    popforum-admin@hplb.hpl.hp.com


-- Services and Contacts ----------------------------------------------

(1) Popforum Administrator
        E-mail: popforum-admin@hplb.hpl.hp.com
            Please send all e-mail requests to this address.  It is
            (theorectically) redirected while the administrator is on
            holiday so that your requests can still be dealt with.

        Address:
            Steve Knight
            Building 2,
            Hewlett-Packard Labs,
            Filton Road,
            Stoke Gifford,
            Bristol,
            Avon BS12 6QZ

        This covers such things as:
            *   subscribing,
            *   back-issues,
            *   members list,
            *   books and resources list.

(2) Popforum
        E-mail: popforum@hplb.hpl.hp.com
            Send to this address to  have your message broadcast to  all
            subscribers.


(3) Agony Uncles
        Suggestions and  advice  can  be  sought  from  popforum  which
        generally provides solutions quickly. However, you may feel that
        that you do not wish to publicise your problems, perhaps because
        they are too "trivial" or perhaps because they are sensitive. In
        this case, you  can write  to one or  more of  the agony  uncles
        below. They will  try to  answer your  questions personally.  If
        they do not  know an  answer, or your  problem is  intrinsically
        interesting, then they may  put the question  to the forum,  but
        without using your name. So you  should get an answer mailed  to
        you in person, or by reading the ensuing discussion. If you  are
        prepared to volunteer as an agony uncle, let me know.

        When writing to one of the volunteers, please clearly indicate
        that you are writing in that context. (Otherwise the volunteer
        may think it is misdirected mail!)
