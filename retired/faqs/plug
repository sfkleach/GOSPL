-- What is PLUG? ------------------------------------------------------

In brief, PLUG is a society which  aims to further the interests of  the
Pop (Poplog and other Pop languages) community.         

Like most user  groups, our members  are people who  use or develop  Pop
systems or  languages  who  wish  to get  together  to  swap  ideas  and
experiences. Its committee is formed  from enthusiasts who work for  the
society on a voluntary basis.

Membership  is  inexpensive  (we  are  not  profit-making).  Joining  is
worthwhile for anyone  who is  likely to  use Pop  for more  than a  few
months and  definitely for  anyone using  Pop for  serious work.  Simply
seeing the  demonstrations at  the  user-group meetings  can be  a  real
eye-opener, for example.

The group's  aim is  to  promote the  interests  of everyone  using  Pop
systems, including  Poplog, AlphaPop,  and Pop-2,  for example.  At  the
moment we offer most to Poplog users, although as AlphaPop becomes  more
widely used, a corresponding shift in emphasis may occur.

We are also independent of commercial interests and willing to argue  on
members behalf for changes to  Pop. For example, membership opinion  has
significantly influenced aspects of both Poplog and AlphaPop, and we are
currently coordinating the effort to standardise Pop-11.


-- Activities and Benefits --------------------------------------------

So what does PLUG  do and what do  members get out of  it? Here are  the
main things.

*   Annual Conference
        We organise a two-day conference every year. We keep costs  to a
        minimum and  hold  it in  University  surroundings in  order  to
        encourage academic attendance. There is a programme of talks and
        question sessions, a parallel  demonstrations programme, and  an
        evening dinner.

*   Newsletter
        We produce the  PLUG newsletter  at least four  times per  year.
        This contains updates on Pop, reviews of Pop products and books,
        keeps you up to date  on the society's activities, and  provides
        another way to make your opinion heard by the Pop community.

*   Helps to Standardise Pop-11
        Acting as a commercially independent  group, we are driving  the
        Pop-11 standardisation  effort.  This  has to  be  handled  with
        sensitivity but we aim to promote the interests of users  rather
        implementers. Obviously, we need users to tell us their views on
        this issue and your views are welcome.

*   Suggests developments and changes to Pop systems
        Our members have made many suggestions and contributions to  the
        development  of  Poplog.  This  function  is  supported  by  the
        communication role of PLUG -- with conferences, newsletter,  and
        pop-forum. You are welcome to contribute too & PLUG is  prepared
        to champion your views, when it is appropriate.

*   Software Library
        We have a library of useful software made up from  contributions
        from members. We support and develop this library. Currently  we
        are working on making it available over electronic-networks.

*   Popforum: Mailing List
        We run a international electronic mailing list, based on the  UK
        academic network  JANET.  This  allows many  people  to  rapidly
        exchange news and views. See HELP *POPFORUM

*   Reviewing Products and Books
        We review Pop products and books and publish the results in  the
        newsletter. We  are  also prepared  to  consult and  referee  in
        confidence.

*   Tutorials
        We are  in the  process of  organising tutorial  sessions.  Your
        input on  this  will  help  us  decide  the  kind  of  material,
        teachers, and environment that are appropriate.

Most of these activities are available to non-members (except they don't
get to hear about them.) However, members are always given  preferential
rates.


-- How to Join --------------------------------------------------------

-- Individual Membership ----------------------------------------------

Write, telephone, or e-mail to the PLUG treasurer (the address is  given
at the end of  this file.) Individual membership  is 10 pounds per  year
and Corporate  membership is  50 pounds  per year.  A year  runs for  12
calendar months from  the month  following receipt  of membership  fees.
(NB: prices  are correct  for 1992,  but not  guaranteed for  subsequent
years - check with the PLUG treasurer for the current membership fee).

SSAISB members are entitled to a 20% discount from the full price.

You can pay by any normal means -- cheques are currently easiest for  us
to deal with.

Please enclose:
    *   something saying you want to join PLUG
    *   your name
    *   contact address & phone number
    *   whether you want corporate or individual membership (if it's  an
        individual membership, state whether or not you are a member  of
        SSAISB)
    *   cheque OR ask for an invoice OR ask for details of direct  debit
        payment

And if you want to get on our electronic mailing list, add:
    *   your e-mail address
    *   current interests
    *   details of the system you are using


-- Corporate Membership -----------------------------------------------

The idea  behind Corporate  membership is  this: many  universities  and
institutions have students  and employees  whose work  brings them  into
contact with Pop intermittently. So although the individuals might  only
use Pop for a few months in a year, the institution is doing so all  the
time. In this case, a someone in the department will want people to join
but it isn't really worthwhile for any individual.

In these circumstances,  corporate membership allows  the department  to
join and, in fact, counts as  five individual memberships. It is a  good
choice for other reasons, too, and currently we have more corporate than
individual members!

Sometimes, an institution  wants its  corporate membership  to count  as
more than five  individual members (for  example, it wants  to get  more
copies of  the  newsletter, send  more  than  five people  to  the  PLUG
conference and get discount  on all of them,  etc.). To allow for  this,
you can apply for 'extended' corporate membership, simply add 10  pounds
per extra  individual  member.  Thus  for 70  pounds,  for  example,  an
institution can have  the benefit of  seven individual members,  without
having to specify seven particular individuals.


-- ISL Maintained Customer Membership ---------------------------------

ISL automatically provide subscriptions to PLUG on behalf of  maintained
customers. The membership  is on an  individual basis and  runs for  the
same period as the maintenance contract.


-- Contact Addresses --------------------------------------------------
