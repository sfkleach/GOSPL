LIB OBJECTCLASS
---------------
The objectclass package is an object-oriented programming extension to Pop11.
It is integrated with the Pop11 type system, provides multiple inheritance
and CLOS-like multi-methods, and is implemented in a compact and efficient
fashion.  It is distributed freely for education and evaluation.

Making OBJECTCLASS available
----------------------------
To make use the objectclass package, you need to add it to your local
library.  To do this, in the objectclass directory created by the
unpacking the tar archive (e.g. $poplocal/local/objectclass)
run the shell script

    install.objectclass

This will
        Copy objectclass.p to $poplocal/local/lib
        Copy objectclass to $poplocal/local/help
        Make a symbolic link from $poplocal/local/lib/objectclass
            to this directory
        Update */obj_index files.

To get on-line help on the package, you can now type the command
    help objectclass
This describes how to make the package available. The objectclass.p
file (LIB OBJECTCLASS) extends poplog's search lists so that the
documentation and library files can be browsed.  (It takes between ten to
twenty seconds to load on Steve Knight's machine.)


Reconfiguring LIB OBJECTCLASS
-----------------------------
Since the objectclass package has a sizeable collection of help files and
autoloadable files, it needs to know where the files exists.  Because the
Poplog library mechanism provides no help for this, it is necessary for
all packages to provide their own ad-hoc solutions.

The ObjectClass package guesses it position by looking for
    $popobjectclass
and if that doesn't exist it uses
    $poplocal
and assumes it has been positioned as per the instructions.


IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER CONCERNING LIB OBJECTCLASS
-----------------------------------------------
This library is experimental and under development.  Although I have made a
serious effort to remove faults in both the documentation and the source code,
it is far from being product quality.  As such, you must treat it as untested
and potentially faulty and take appropriate precautions.

This library is freely distributed for evaluation purposes.  Please ensure
that any modifications are clearly marked before passing copies to any third
parties.  Such notes should appear both as a general disclaimer in the copy of
this notice and in a more detailed form in the modified files.

If you have any suggestions or modifications that you would like included,
I would be delighted to hear from you.
